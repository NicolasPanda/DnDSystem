# Mobile RPG System

Mobile RPG System is a simple and intuitive system for playing tabletop RPG games inspired by the video game For The King. It allows players to cast spells and manage their equipment with ease. The in-game chat is interactive and real-time, making it easy for both the players and the game master to interact with each other.

We strongly recommend coupling this system with a tabletop tool such as Foundry VTT or TaleSpire for the best experience. The system includes an interface for the game master to manage combat and player actions on a PC screen. You are free to use or fork the system as you wish, but please do mention me if you use my code.

Please note that I will not be responding to any questions or bug-fix requests. Have fun playing!

## Getting Started

## Usage

Once you have the system up and running, players can create their characters, join the game, and start playing. The game master can manage combat and the actions of the players using the PC interface.
